## Basics

Houm.io provides a REST/Websocket for controlling and configuring lights.

A `site` is conceptually equal to a home, office etc. It contains your lights, scenes, button configurations and so on. A `sitekey` is a key for accessing a site.

Contact Houm.io for a sitekey, if you don't have one.

Once you have a sitekey, for example `yoursecretsitekey`, the web UI for your site is at https://houm.herokuapp.com/site/yoursecretsitekey.

## Using the REST API

All API calls are prefixed by `https://houm.herokuapp.com/api/site/yoursecretsitekey`.

We use [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) to execute the api calls in our examples.

### Get all lights

Execute the following command:

`curl -X GET https://houm.herokuapp.com/site/yoursecretsitekey/light`

The response is similar to:

```
[
  {
    "vendor": "enocean",
    "_id": "5400d38340396f02001bf573",
    "siteid": "yoursecretkey",
    "name": "Eteinen: Kattovalot",
    "type": "dimmable",
    "enoceanid": "unknown",
    "subdef": "ff:ee:33:00",
    "on": true,
    "bri": 255
  },
  {
    "vendor": "enocean",
    "_id": "5400e45a6f77220200232516",
    "siteid": "yoursecretkey",
    "name": "Kylpyhuone: Etuvalot",
    "enoceanid": "unknown",
    "subdef": "ff:ee:33:05",
    "type": "dimmable",
    "on": true,
    "bri": 255
  },
  {
    "vendor": "enocean",
    "_id": "5400e3e06f77220200232515",
    "siteid": "yoursecretkey",
    "name": "Kylpyhuone: Takavalot",
    "enoceanid": "unknown",
    "subdef": "ff:ee:33:04",
    "type": "dimmable",
    "on": true,
    "bri": 255
  }
]
```

Essential parts are:

* `_id`: This is what you use to refer to this light (see below).
* `name`: This is the name of the light.
* `type`: This is either `dimmable` (dimmable light) or `binary` (on/off light)
* `on`: Whether the light is on or off.
* `bri`: The brightness of a light. For dimmable lights, the value is in the range 0â€“255. 0 means off, 255 means full steam. For binary lights, this is always 0 or 255.

### Set light state

Get the `_id` of the light you want to set.

To set a dimmable light to 50%, execute the following command.

```
curl \
-X PUT \
-d '{ "_id": "yourlightid", "on": true, "bri": 127 }' \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
https://houm.herokuapp.com/site/yoursecretsitekey/light/state
```

To set a dimmable light at full power, set data to

`'{ "_id": "yourlightid", "on": true, "bri": 255 }'`.

To switch off a dimmable light, set data to

`'{ "_id": "yourlightid", "on": false, "bri": 0 }'`.
